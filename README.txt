Project Title: Plant Purchase Website(SolPlant)
------------------------------------------------
Project Description:
SolPlant is a single page of a plant selling website developed using HTML & CSS and a little bit 
of JavaScript. I found the UI template of this website in the internet and decided to develope it
as my first serious project with HTML and CSS(I had developed some small projects earlier).
Solplant is completely responsive for diffrent view sizes(mobile,Tablet,small laptops and large laptops).
This project helped me have a better understanding of HTML and CSS(especially what amazing things you can do using pure CSS)
and challenged my knowledge in some aspects(like responsive web design, different selectors of CSS, Flex and grid layout ,...).
